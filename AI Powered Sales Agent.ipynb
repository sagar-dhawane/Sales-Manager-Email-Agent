    "\n",
    "**CRITICAL RULES:**\n",
    "1. **Banned Phrases:** Do NOT use \"I hope this message finds you well\" or \"I am writing to you today\". Start directly with the value.\n",
    "2. **No Placeholders:** Do NOT use brackets like [Achievement]. If the user input didn't give you a specific company achievement, skip that sentence. Do not make things up that look fake.\n",
    "3. **Data:** Use the specific metric: \"30% increase in operational efficiency.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "1. Observation: \"I noticed your company is scaling...\" (Or use specific context if provided).\n",
    "2. The Insight: Connect growth to the complexity of operations.\n",
    "3. The Solution: \"Timelith helps teams reclaim lost time. Clients typically see a 30% efficiency gain.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**CRITICAL RULES:**\n",
    "1. **Length:** MAXIMUM 50 words. If it is longer, you fail.\n",
    "2. **Formatting:** No bolding, no bullet points, no HTML. Plain text only.\n",
    "3. **Tone:** Casual. Use \"Best,\" or \"Cheers,\" as the sign-off.\n",
    "4. **No Placeholders:** Never use brackets. If you don't have the name, just start with \"Hi,\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "1. The \"Ask\": One sentence explaining what Timelith does (e.g., \"We built a tool that automates [Key Benefit].\").\n",

    "\n",
    "**CRITICAL RULES:**\n",
    "1. **NO PLACEHOLDERS:** Never use square brackets like [Name] or [Company]. If you do not know the prospect's specific name, use \"Hi there\" or \"Hello Team\". If you don't know their specific industry stat, use a general but realistic industry benchmark (e.g., \"Most firms lose 20% efficiency...\").\n",
    "2. **NO FLUFF:** Strictly forbidden from using \"I hope this email finds you well\" or \"Just checking in\".\n",
    "3. **Assertiveness:** You are an equal, not a subordinate. Challenge their current process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "1. Hook: State a hard truth or expensive problem (e.g., \"Resource leakage is silently killing margins\").\n",
    "2. Agitate: Explain that the old way of tracking time is obsolete.\n",
    "3. Solve: Introduce Timelith as the *only* logical fix.\n",
    "4. CTA: \"Are you open to a 10-minute debate on this?\"\n",
